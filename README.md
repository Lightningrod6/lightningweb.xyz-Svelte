# lightningweb.xyz

The personal site of Liam Caywood (Lightning) — rebuilt on the modern Svelte stack.

## Stack

- **Svelte 5** (runes) + **SvelteKit 2**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (CSS-first tokens, no config file)
- **@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare** — deploys to Cloudflare Pages
- Fonts: Inter Tight Variable (text), JetBrains Mono Variable (labels)

## Design

Clean and confident: Inter Tight for words and JetBrains Mono for small labels, warm neutrals with one amber
accent, project cards with status, tags and a call to action, gentle hover states and a single fade-up on load.
Light by default with a dark mode that follows the OS. All copy lives in `src/lib/content.ts`.

## Developing

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run check   # svelte-check
npm run build   # production build into dist/ (Cloudflare Pages output)
```

## Pages

- `/` — hero, system status plate, featured projects, about teaser, community strip
- `/projects` — everything wired up
- `/about-me` — personnel file
- `/contributions` — voice acting cameo
- `/community` — the Discord hub
